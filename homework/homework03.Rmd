# Weather Prediction

This homework concerns hourly USCRN weather data. We studied the same dataset
in the lecture, except aggregated to the daily level. I have saved the 2024
hourly data in the github repository in "datasets/hourly_uscrn_weather_2024.csv"

1. The response for our prediction model will be the Salem, MO data. Read in 
   the data and make a plot
   of the data against time. This will require you to calculate an "hours since midnight
   on January 1st" variable. 
   
   Make another plot showing whatever interesting features you like, such as
   relationships between the Salem data and the data from the other sites.

```{r}
```

2. Our first task is to de-trend the data. Fit a model to the Salem, MO data
   that accounts for both broad trends over the year and the small trends within
   each day, that is, the fact that it tends to be cooler at night and warmer
   in the morning.

```{r}
```

3. Explore the fit of this model by plotting the fitted values over time, and
by plotting the residuals against some other variables. Include at least two
plots total for this question, and explain in words what you find.

```{r}
```

4. Fit the same model to all the other sites, separately for each site. Then
   add the resduals from these models to the data frame, with appropriate
   column names.

```{r}
```


5. Calculate the sample covariance matrix for the residuals, and the corresponding
sample correlation matrix. Print out these two matrices and leave some short comments
about them. Which pairs of sites are most highly correlated. Which least correlated?

```{r}
```

6. As we did in class, using the residuals, add one-hour lagged value for each
   site to the data frame. Double check that you have lined them up properly.

```{r}
```

7. Do a linear regression of the Salem residuals on its own lagged value. Print out
   the summary table, and comment on the results. What is the size of the error
   from this model? How does the size of the error compare to the overall variation
   in the residuals?

```{r}
```


8. Perform a multiple linear regression of the Salem data on all of the lagged
   values (including the Salem lagged value). What do you find? Do the answers
   make sense given locations of the sites? Look at a map of the sites to help
   you answer.

```{r}
```

9. Bonus: Given all that you've done here, try to produce a better weather prediction
   model for the Salem residuals. The only constraint is that your model can't
   use any information from the current time's residuals, only data from prior
   residuals.

```{r}
```
